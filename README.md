Unity Script Assets

Unfortunately I lost access to my previous Github account, previously ManyByteStudios.
Here is where you will find the custom attributes, utility scripts and game mechanic scripts that I have made and used.
These scripts have been updated and adjusted to work with Unity 2022.3.36, will test with Unity 6 once it officaly launches.

The Custom Attributes that I have created comes in 1 folder, with 1 documentation on how to use it.
Utility and Game Mechanic scripts are seperated by folders and comes with their own documentation.

Feel free to use and adjust these scripts to your needs.
