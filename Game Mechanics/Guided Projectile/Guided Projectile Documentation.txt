Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import the script into your project. To use this
script simply replace "MonoBehaviour" with this script's class name, "GuidedProjectile".

IF the script does not work or you do not wish to download the Custom Attributes simply remove 
the various custom attributes and the code will run fine.

SetTarget(...) and EnableTracking() are the methods that determine the what object is being tracked
and if the projectile is tracking or not.

ControlProjectile(...) must be called during Fixed Update and is the core logic and function
of the script.
