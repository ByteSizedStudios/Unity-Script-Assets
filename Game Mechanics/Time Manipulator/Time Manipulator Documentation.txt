Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import the script into your project. To use this
script simply replace "MonoBehaviour" with this script's class name, "TimeManipulator".

If the script does not work or you do not wish to download the Custom Attributes simply remove 
the various custom attributes and the code will run fine. This script also uses my "DontDestroy"
script, you can replace it with "MonoBehaviour".

Calling the method SetTimeScale(float NewTimeScale) will change the time scale speed
in unity to the desired speed. Please note that the time scale cannot go lower than 0.

Calling the method GetTimeScale() returns the current time scale in Unity.

Calling the method LerpTimeScale(float SmoothSpeed, float NewTimeScale) will gradually
change the time scale speed in Unity to the desired speed.
