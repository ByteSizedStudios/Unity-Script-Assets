Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import the script into your project. You can choose
to have multiple objects with the same script or use inheritance to have multiple
versions of the script. To inherit the scrip simply replace "MonoBehaviour" with
this script's class name, "DontDestroy".

This script simply allows for any given object to have only one instance of that 
object in the scene. The script also allows for the same instance object with this
script to be loaded across different scenes.
